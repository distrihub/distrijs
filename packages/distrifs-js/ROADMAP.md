# distrifs-js Roadmap

## Recently completed
- [x] VS Code-style dialog for creating files and folders
- [x] Collapsible explorer with ShadCN layout and optional single-tab mode
- [x] Collapsible sidebar + preview sheet for focused editing
- [x] Chat-enabled workspace surface that shares filesystem tools with agents
- [x] Script runner UI tool that issues `distri_execute_code` tasks from the chat

## Near-term
- [ ] Replace the textarea editor with a Monaco-based code experience
- [ ] Persist explorer expansion + last-active tab between sessions
- [ ] Emit toast notifications for tool-driven filesystem changes
- [ ] Provide a lightweight diff viewer when agent edits are applied

## Future ideas
- [ ] Sync workspace state to remote storage for collaborative editing
- [ ] Bundle richer previews (Markdown, JSON schema, Mermaid diagrams)
- [ ] Add playwright-powered smoke tests for the sample app
