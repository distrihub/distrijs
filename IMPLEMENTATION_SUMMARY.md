# Implementation Summary: Event-Driven UX Mapping

## Overview
Successfully implemented the new event-driven UX mapping for the feat/strategies branch with step-by-step execution flow similar to Cursor's inline interface.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Updated Core Types (`packages/core/src/types.ts`)
- Added `TaskMessage` interface with support for strategy-based execution
- Added execution step data types: `PlanStartedData`, `PlanFinishedData`, `StepStartedData`, `StepCompletedData`
- Added tool execution types: `ToolExecutionStartData`, `ToolExecutionEndData`, `ToolRejectedData`
- Added `ExecutionStep` interface for step tracking
- Updated `DistriStreamEvent` union to include `TaskMessage`
- Added type guards: `isTaskMessage()`, updated `isDistriEvent()`

### 2. Enhanced Event System (`packages/core/src/events.ts`)
- Added new strategy-based events:
  - `PlanStartedEvent` - When planner begins generating plan
  - `PlanFinishedEvent` - When planner completes plan with steps
  - `StepStartedEvent` - When execution step begins  
  - `StepCompletedEvent` - When execution step finishes
  - `ToolRejectedEvent` - When tool call is rejected
- Updated existing events with enhanced data structures
- Added step tracking to tool events

### 3. ExecutionSteps Component (`packages/react/src/components/ExecutionSteps.tsx`)
- **ExecutionSteps**: Animated step-by-step UI with Cursor-like interface
- **ExecutionTracker**: Real-time tracking of task messages and execution state
- **Features**:
  - âœ… Expandable steps with arrow indicators
  - âœ… Status icons (pending, running, completed, failed)
  - âœ… Animated loading states and progress indicators
  - âœ… Inline step results display
  - âœ… Planning phase indicator with spinner
  - âœ… Real-time step status updates

### 4. Updated Chat System (`packages/react/src/useChat.ts`)
- Enhanced `useChat` hook to handle `TaskMessage` types
- Added `taskMessages` state tracking
- Updated stream event handling for new event types
- Added separate task message processing pipeline
- Updated return interface with `taskMessages` array

### 5. Integrated UI Components
- **EmbeddableChat**: Integrated ExecutionTracker component
- **FullChat**: Added execution tracking to full chat interface
- Updated message filtering and rendering
- Added TaskMessage support to all chat components

## ðŸŽ¯ UX Mapping Implementation

The implementation follows the exact UX mapping specification:

| Event | When Triggered | UI Feedback | âœ… Status |
|-------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| RunStarted | Agent execution begins | Show loading spinner | âœ… Implemented |
| PlanStarted/Finished | Planner generates plan | "Planning steps..." | âœ… Implemented |
| StepStarted | Start of execution step | "Thinking on step X" | âœ… Implemented |
| TextMessage* | LLM streaming | Stream LLM output | âœ… Existing + Enhanced |
| ToolExecutionStart/End | Tool is run | Show spinner, then result | âœ… Implemented |
| ToolRejected | Rejection from frontend/A2A | Show rejection prompt | âœ… Implemented |
| StepCompleted | Step finishes | Tick/checkmark | âœ… Implemented |
| RunFinished | Agent is done | Final summary | âœ… Implemented |

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Features

### Step-by-Step Animation
- Each step appears on a new line when running
- Smooth animations using Tailwind transitions
- Expandable content with chevron indicators
- Color-coded status indicators

### Cursor-like Interface
- Clean, minimal design with proper spacing
- Left border indicating active steps
- Inline result display on expansion
- Consistent with existing design system

### Real-time Updates
- Live status tracking as events stream in
- Progressive disclosure of step information
- Responsive animations and state changes

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support for all new types
- Discriminated unions for task message data
- Proper type guards for runtime checks

### Event Processing
- Efficient event handling pipeline
- Separate task message state management
- Real-time synchronization with step tracking

### Component Structure
- Reusable ExecutionSteps component
- Centralized ExecutionTracker for state management
- Clean integration with existing chat components

## ðŸš€ Ready for feat/strategies Integration

The implementation is fully prepared for the feat/strategies branch:
- All TaskMessage types conform to expected structure
- Event handling supports SSE streaming
- First-time load compatibility for existing messages
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements

The new UX provides a modern, Cursor-like experience for strategy-based agent execution with clear visual feedback and smooth animations.
